Below you will find my list of blogs curated from years of scrounging the
Internet.

Naturally, they relate to the topics I care about. Thus as a reader of my 
blog, you'll likely find them captivating too. Take a look and add a few to your
bookmarks bar!

_This list will be updated overtime._

## Software

|Blog|Author|Why Read this Blog?
|---|---|---|
|[Joel on Software](https://joelonsoftware.com)|Joel Spolsky|Joel is one of the two [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) founders. Having created perhaps the most important Q&A forum for the software industry in the 2010s, his opinions on software, startup, and careers are quite worth checking out.|
|[Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)|Jeff Atwood|Jeff is the other [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) founder, who is also an avid blogger. His themes are very similar to Joel's.
|[DHH](https://m.signalvnoise.com/author/dhh/)|David Heinemeier Hansson| David is the creator of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). He also co-founded [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and writes about software, open source, working culture, and startups.
|[Kalzumeus Software](https://www.kalzumeus.com/)|Patrick McKenzie| Patrick ran a software company in Japan and writes about the industry. He is quite knowledgable. One of my all-time-favourite is his [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/).

## Start-up

|[Paul Graham's Essays](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)|Paul Graham|Paul is the co-founder of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and created [that orange website](https://news.ycombinator.com/). His essays on startups and entrepreneurship are all excellent. [Here](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)'s a good one to start with. Paul doesn't post very regularly though.
|[AVC](https://avc.com/)|Fred Wilson|Fred is the co-founder of [Union Square Ventures](https://www.usv.com/). He posts daily about the start-up world.

## Life

|Blog|Author|Why Read this Blog?
|---|---|---|
|[Seth's Blog](https://seths.blog/)|Seth Godin|Seth is an entrepreneur-turned-author. His daily blog posts (more like _nuggets_ as they are all very short) contain many interesting thoughts and observations surrounding entrepreneurship and personal growth.
|[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)|Tim Urban|Tim is an [expert procastinator](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) who escapes daily responsiblities by writing excellent long blog posts. His long series are very fun but can take a while to read, so make sure to leave yourself enough time!

## Finance
