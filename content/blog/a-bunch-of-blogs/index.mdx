Blogs are among the Internet's greatest boons.

Finding great ones, however, can be difficult (you might be on one!).

Below is my curated list of blogs made from years of scrounging the Internet.
Naturally, they relate to the topics I care about. Thus as reader of my blog,
you'll likely find them captivating too. So take a look and add a few to your 
bookmarks bar!. 

_This list will be updated as time passes._

|Blog|Short Intro|
|---|---|
|[Joel on Software](https://joelonsoftware.com)|This is Joel Spolsky's blog, who is perhaps most known as the co-creator of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). He writes a lot on programming, software, and startup.
|[Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)|This is Jeff Atwood's blog, who is the _other_ co-creator of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). I find it quite interesting that both founders are quite avid bloggers. Jeff also writes a lot around software development.
|[DHH](https://m.signalvnoise.com/author/dhh/)|David Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of Ruby on Rails. He also co-created [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and writes about software, open source, working culture, and startups.|
|[Kalzumeus Software](https://www.kalzumeus.com/)|Patrick McKenzie ran a software company in Japan and writes about the industry. One of my all-time-favourite is his [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) post.
|[Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/)|A light-hearted blog on software development by Robert Heaton. His [HTTPS](https://robertheaton.com/2018/11/28/https-in-the-real-world/) piece is superb and the [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/) series fill a niche gap for those who are past "Hello World" but not yet "Amazon.com clone".
|[Paul Graham's Essays](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)|Paul Graham is the co-founder of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and created [that orange website](https://news.ycombinator.com/). His essays on startups and entrepreneurship are all excellent. [Here](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)'s a good one to start with. He doesn't post very regularly though.
|[AVC](https://avc.com/)|This is Fred Wilson's, who co-founded the VC firm [Union Square Ventures](https://www.usv.com/). His daily posts on the startup world are quite insightful.
|[Seth's Blog](https://seths.blog/)|Seth Godin is an entrepreneur-turned-author. His daily blog posts (more like _nuggets_ as they are all very short) contain many interesting thoughts and observations surrounding entrepreneurship and personal growth.
|[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)|Tim Urban is an [expert procastinator](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) who escapes daily responsiblities by writing excellent long blog posts. His series are very fun but can take a while to read through, so make sure to leave yourself enough time!
|[Money Talk](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine)|This is Matt Levine's, an ex-Goldman banker turned Bloomberg columnist. This is a finance blog. Matt's comments are often insightful and entertaining. If you choose to only read one finance blog, pick this one.
